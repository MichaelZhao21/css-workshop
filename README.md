# CSS Workshop

This is a workshop hosted for TAMS CSO on 3/24/2021! I go over the basics of html and css through a live demo presentation. If you would like to follow along, fork this repo (either on gh or on codesandbox) and clear the contents of the `index.css` file. If hosting locally, install with `yarn install` and run (using live reload) with `yarn dev`.
